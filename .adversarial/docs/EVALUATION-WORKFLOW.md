## Overview

The adversarial workflow provides independent quality assurance using **external AI** (via Aider CLI) for three types of content:

1. **Plan Evaluation** (`adversarial evaluate`) - Review implementation plans and architectural decisions
2. **Proofreading** (`adversarial proofread`) - Review teaching/documentation content quality
3. **Code Review** (`adversarial review`) - Review implemented code for quality and correctness

**Key Benefit**: Catch issues early—design flaws in plans, clarity problems in teaching content, or bugs in code—before they compound.

---

## Available Evaluators

As of adversarial-workflow v0.7.0, three built-in evaluators are available (require OPENAI_API_KEY):

| Command | Purpose | Best For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `adversarial evaluate` | Plan evaluation | Task specs, architecture docs, implementation plans |
| `adversarial proofread` | Teaching content review | Concepts, guides, tutorials, documentation |
| `adversarial review` | Code review | Implemented code, PRs, refactoring validation |

**Discover evaluators:**
```bash
adversarial list-evaluators
```

---

## Three Modes: Evaluate, Proofread, Review

### `adversarial evaluate` - For Implementation Plans

**Use for:**
- Task specifications (TASK-*.md)
- Code architecture plans
- Implementation approaches
- Technical design decisions

**Evaluates:**
- Completeness, design quality, risk assessment
- Implementation clarity (file/function names)
- Error handling, test coverage
- Dependencies, edge cases

**Output:** `.adversarial/logs/TASK-*-PLAN-EVALUATION.md`

---

### `adversarial proofread` - For Teaching Content

**Use for:**
- Concept documents (teaching explanations)
- Examples (real-world applications)
- Practice exercises
- Documentation guides

**Evaluates:**
- Clarity, accuracy, engagement
- Pedagogical structure
- Examples quality
- Style guide/glossary consistency

**Output:** `.adversarial/logs/<doc-name>-PROOFREADING.md`

---

### `adversarial review` - For Implemented Code

**Use for:**
- Completed implementations before merge
- Pull request validation
- Refactoring verification
- Code quality audits

**Evaluates:**
- Code correctness and logic
- Error handling completeness
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Test coverage adequacy
- Code style and maintainability

**Output:** `.adversarial/logs/<identifier>-CODE-REVIEW.md`

---

### Quick Decision Guide

| Content Type | Command | Why |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| Task specification with implementation details | `evaluate` | Needs code-focused review |
| Architecture decision document | `evaluate` | Needs technical design review |
| Concept explanation (teaching) | `proofread` | Needs clarity/pedagogy review |
| Real-world example with code | `proofread` | Teaching content (even with code) |
| Practice exercise | `proofread` | Educational effectiveness |
| API documentation | `proofread` | User-facing clarity |
| README or guide | `proofread` | Teaching/explaining |
| Completed feature implementation | `review` | Needs code correctness review |
| Bug fix before merge | `review` | Verify fix is correct |
| Refactored code | `review` | Verify behavior preserved |
| Pull request changes | `review` | Pre-merge quality check |

**Rule of thumb:**
- **Planning code?** → `evaluate`
- **Teaching someone?** → `proofread`
- **Code already written?** → `review`

---

## Discovering Evaluators

Use the `list-evaluators` command to see all available evaluators:

```bash
adversarial list-evaluators
```

**Example output:**
```
Built-in Evaluators:
  evaluate       Plan evaluation (OpenAI)
  proofread      Teaching content review (OpenAI)
  review         Code review (OpenAI)

Local Evaluators:
  security       Security-focused code review
  performance    Performance analysis

Create .adversarial/evaluators/*.yml to add custom evaluators.
```

This command shows:
- **Built-in evaluators**: Shipped with adversarial-workflow
- **Local evaluators**: Custom evaluators defined in your project

---

## Custom Evaluators

You can create project-specific evaluators by adding YAML files to `.adversarial/evaluators/`.

### Creating a Custom Evaluator

**1. Create the evaluator file:**
```bash
mkdir -p .adversarial/evaluators
```

**2. Define the evaluator (e.g., `.adversarial/evaluators/security.yml`):**
```yaml
name: security
description: Security-focused code review
model: gpt-4o  # Or: gemini/gemini-2.0-flash, mistral/mistral-large-latest, etc.
api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY  # Environment variable for API key

prompt: |
  You are a security expert reviewing code for vulnerabilities.
  
  Focus on:
  - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Authentication and authorization flaws
  - Secrets and credential exposure
  - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS)
  
  For each issue found, provide:
  - Severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  - Location (file:line)
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Recommended fix
  
  End with a verdict: APPROVED, NEEDS_REVISION, or REJECT

output_suffix: SECURITY-REVIEW
```

**3. Use the custom evaluator:**
```bash
adversarial security src/auth/login.py
```

### Custom Evaluator Schema

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Command name (lowercase, no spaces) |
| `description` | Yes | Short description shown in `list-evaluators` |
| `model` | No | AI model to use (see aider docs for formats) |
| `api_key_env` | No | Environment variable for API key |
| `prompt` | Yes | System prompt for the evaluator |
| `output_suffix` | No | Suffix for output files (default: EVALUATION) |

### Example Use Cases

- **Security review**: Focus on vulnerabilities and exploits
- **Performance review**: Analyze algorithmic complexity and bottlenecks
- **Accessibility review**: Check for WCAG compliance
- **API review**: Validate REST/GraphQL design patterns
- **Database review**: Check query efficiency and schema design

### Evaluator Library

Pre-built evaluators for multiple providers are available:

```bash
# Install evaluators from the evaluator library
./scripts/project install-evaluators

# See all available evaluators (built-in + custom + library)
adversarial list-evaluators
```

**Installed providers include:**
- OpenAI (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o3, gpt-5.2)
- Google (gemini-flash, gemini-pro, gemini-deep)
- Mistral (mistral-fast, mistral-content, codestral-code)

Each provider requires its own API key (set in `.env`):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI evaluators
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for Gemini evaluators
- `MISTRAL_API_KEY` for Mistral evaluators

**Documentation**: `.adversarial/evaluators/README.md`
**Library**: https://github.com/movito/adversarial-evaluator-library

## What It Is (and Isn't)

### ✅ What It IS:

- **External AI evaluator** invoked via `adversarial evaluate` or `adversarial proofread` CLI commands
- Uses Aider to call external AI APIs (OpenAI, Google, Mistral, etc.)
- Saves output to `.adversarial/logs/` with different suffixes:
  - Evaluation: `TASK-*-PLAN-EVALUATION.md`
  - Proofreading: `<doc-name>-PROOFREADING.md`
- Independent critical review from a different AI model (external evaluator, not Claude)

### ❌ What It is NOT:

- **NOT** Claude in a new UI tab (that's for manual user review)
- **NOT** a Claude Code Task tool agent (those create phantom work that doesn't persist)
- **NOT** a Claude Code subagent (evaluators are external, via CLI)
- **NOT** a replacement for human review (it's a complement)

### 🔍 Critical Clarification:

The `.claude/CLAUDE.md` instruction "Always launch agents in new tabs" refers to opening **Claude Desktop UI tabs** for manual review by the user. This is **NOT** the same as the adversarial workflow, which is an external AI evaluator invoked via CLI.

**Confusion Prevention:**
- "Give this to Evaluator" = Run `adversarial evaluate` command (external AI via CLI)
- "Proofread this document" = Run `adversarial proofread` command (external AI via CLI)
- "Open in new tab for review" = User opens Claude Desktop tab for manual review
- They are completely different workflows!

---

## When to Use Each Mode

### Use `adversarial evaluate` for:

- ✅ **Before assigning implementation tasks** to specialized agents
- ✅ **Complex tasks** (>500 lines) with multiple phases
- ✅ **Critical dependencies or risks** that need validation
- ✅ **After creating/updating task specifications**
- ✅ **Architectural decision documents**

Skip `evaluate` for:
- ❌ Trivial tasks (<100 lines)
- ❌ Bug fixes with obvious solutions
- ❌ Teaching/documentation content (use `proofread` instead)

---

### Use `adversarial proofread` for:

- ✅ **Teaching content** (concepts, explanations)
- ✅ **Documentation guides** (READMEs, how-tos)
- ✅ **Real-world examples** with educational purpose
- ✅ **Practice exercises** and learning materials
- ✅ **API documentation** and user-facing content

Skip `proofread` for:
- ❌ Implementation plans (use `evaluate` instead)
- ❌ Code architecture documents (use `evaluate` instead)
- ❌ Technical specifications (use `evaluate` instead)

---

### Use `adversarial review` for:

- ✅ **Completed implementations** before merge
- ✅ **Bug fixes** to verify correctness
- ✅ **Refactored code** to ensure behavior preserved
- ✅ **Pull request changes** for pre-merge validation
- ✅ **Critical path code** requiring extra scrutiny

Skip `review` for:
- ❌ Planning documents (use `evaluate` instead)
- ❌ Teaching content (use `proofread` instead)
- ❌ Configuration files (usually not worth the cost)
- ❌ Trivial changes (<10 lines)

---

## Plan Evaluation Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process:

**1. Planner creates task specification**
```bash
# Create in delegation/tasks/2-todo/
delegation/tasks/2-todo/TASK-XXXX-description.md
```

**2. Planner runs evaluation directly via Bash tool**
```bash
# For files < 500 lines:
adversarial evaluate delegation/tasks/2-todo/TASK-XXXX-description.md

# For large files (>500 lines) requiring interactive confirmation:
echo y | adversarial evaluate delegation/tasks/2-todo/TASK-XXXX-description.md
```
- This invokes Aider with the configured evaluator model
- The evaluator analyzes the plan using evaluation criteria
- Output saved to `.adversarial/logs/TASK-XXXX-PLAN-EVALUATION.md`

**3. Planner reads evaluation output**
```bash
# Read evaluation results
cat .adversarial/logs/TASK-XXXX-PLAN-EVALUATION.md
```

**4. Planner addresses CRITICAL and HIGH priority feedback**
- Fix design flaws identified by the evaluator
- Add missing requirements
- Clarify ambiguous specifications
- Address risk concerns

**5. Planner updates task file based on recommendations**
- Edit task specification in `delegation/tasks/2-todo/`
- Incorporate the evaluator's suggestions
- Improve clarity and completeness

**6. If NEEDS_REVISION: Repeat steps 2-5**
- Optimal: 2-3 evaluation rounds
- Diminishing returns after 3 rounds
- Use planner judgment

**7. If APPROVED (or planner override): Assign to specialized agent**
- Create handoff document
- Update agent-handoffs.json
- Begin implementation

---

## Proofreading Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process:

**1. Agent creates teaching/documentation content**
```bash
# Create in appropriate documentation directory
docs/agentive-development/01-foundation/01-structured-ai-collaboration/concept.md
```

**2. Agent or planner runs proofreading directly via Bash tool**
```bash
# For files < 500 lines:
adversarial proofread docs/agentive-development/01-foundation/01-structured-ai-collaboration/concept.md

# For large files (>500 lines) requiring interactive confirmation:
echo y | adversarial proofread docs/agentive-development/01-foundation/01-structured-ai-collaboration/concept.md
```
- This invokes Aider with the configured evaluator model
- The evaluator analyzes content using proofreading criteria
- Output saved to `.adversarial/logs/concept-PROOFREADING.md`

**3. Agent reads proofreading output**
```bash
# Read proofreading results
cat .adversarial/logs/concept-PROOFREADING.md
```

**4. Agent addresses CRITICAL and HIGH priority feedback**
- Fix inaccuracies or confusing explanations
- Add missing citations or sources
- Improve clarity and engagement
- Address style guide/glossary inconsistencies

**5. Agent updates document based on recommendations**
- Edit teaching content based on the evaluator's suggestions
- Add better examples if needed
- Improve pedagogical flow
- Ensure terminology consistency

**6. If NEEDS_REVISION: Repeat steps 2-5**
- Optimal: 1-2 proofreading rounds (teaching content stabilizes faster)
- Diminishing returns after 2 rounds
- Use agent/planner judgment

**7. If APPROVED: Publish or commit document**
- Teaching content is ready for readers
- Commit to repository
- Share with learners

---

## Code Review Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process:

**1. Implementation is complete**
```bash
# Code is written and tests pass locally
pytest tests/ -v
```

**2. Run code review via Bash tool**
```bash
# Review specific files:
adversarial review src/feature/new_module.py

# Review multiple files:
adversarial review src/feature/

# Review with context from task spec:
adversarial review src/feature/ --context delegation/tasks/3-in-progress/TASK-0001.md
```
- This invokes Aider with the configured evaluator model
- The evaluator analyzes code using review criteria
- Output saved to `.adversarial/logs/<identifier>-CODE-REVIEW.md`

**3. Read code review output**
```bash
# Read review results
cat .adversarial/logs/new_module-CODE-REVIEW.md
```

**4. Address CRITICAL and HIGH priority findings**
- Fix bugs and logic errors
- Address security vulnerabilities
- Improve error handling
- Add missing edge case handling

**5. Update code based on recommendations**
- Implement suggested fixes
- Run tests to verify changes
- Ensure no regressions

**6. If NEEDS_REVISION: Repeat steps 2-5**
- Typical: 1-2 review rounds for code
- Code reviews often surface concrete bugs
- Focus on CRITICAL/HIGH issues

**7. If APPROVED: Proceed to merge**
- Code is ready for integration
- Create PR or merge to main
- Move task to done

---

## Evaluation Criteria (Code Plans)

The evaluator analyzes plans using these criteria:

### 1. **Completeness Check**
- Does the plan address ALL requirements?
- Are all failing tests covered?
- Are edge cases identified?
- Is error handling specified?

### 2. **Design Quality**
- Is the approach sound?
- Are there simpler alternatives?
- Will this scale/maintain well?
- Are there hidden dependencies?

### 3. **Risk Assessment**
- What could go wrong?
- Are there breaking changes?
- Impact on existing code?
- Test coverage adequate?

### 4. **Implementation Clarity**
- Is the plan detailed enough to implement?
- Are file/function names specified?
- Is the sequence of changes clear?
- Are acceptance criteria defined?

### 5. **Missing Elements**
- What's not addressed in the plan?
- Are there unstated assumptions?
- Dependencies on other tasks?
- Documentation needs?

---

## Proofreading Criteria (Teaching Content)

The evaluator proofreads teaching content using these criteria:

### 1. **Clarity**
- Are explanations clear and understandable?
- Are complex ideas broken down effectively?
- Is jargon explained when first used?
- Can a developer unfamiliar with the topic follow along?

### 2. **Accuracy**
- Are facts, metrics, and claims correct?
- Are sources cited (file paths, task references, ADRs)?
- Are code examples correct and runnable?
- Are claims verifiable?

### 3. **Engagement**
- Is the content interesting to read?
- Does it maintain an approachable, conversational tone?
- Are there concrete examples and stories?
- Does it avoid being too dry or academic?

### 4. **Pedagogical Structure**
- Does it teach effectively (concept → example → practice)?
- Is there a logical progression of ideas?
- Is the depth appropriate for the target audience?
- Are key takeaways clear?

### 5. **Completeness**
- Are all key concepts covered?
- Is important information missing?
- Is there too much or too little detail?
- Does it answer likely reader questions?

### 6. **Examples**
- Are examples real (not contrived/toy examples)?
- Do examples illustrate the concept effectively?
- Can examples be generalized to other contexts?
- Are code examples cited with file paths?

### 7. **Consistency**
- Voice: Second person, active voice, present tense?
- Terminology: Matches project glossary?
- Formatting: Consistent with style guide?
- Tone: Matches other teaching content?

**Style Guide Integration:**
- Automatically checks `.agent-context/documentation-style-guide.md` if present
- Automatically checks `.agent-context/agentive-development-glossary.md` if present
- Evaluates against these standards

**Does NOT evaluate for:**
- ❌ File/function names (teaching content, not code planning)
- ❌ Error handling in the document itself (unless evaluating code examples within)
- ❌ Implementation acceptance criteria (success criteria are learning outcomes)
- ❌ Technical architecture decisions

---

## Code Review Criteria

The evaluator reviews implemented code using these criteria:

### 1. **Correctness**
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are there logic errors or off-by-one bugs?
- Are edge cases handled correctly?
- Does it match the specification/requirements?

### 2. **Error Handling**
- Are errors caught and handled appropriately?
- Are error messages helpful for debugging?
- Is there proper cleanup on failure?
- Are exceptions used correctly (not for flow control)?

### 3. **Security**
- Are inputs validated and sanitized?
- Is there protection against injection attacks?
- Are secrets/credentials handled safely?
- Are permissions checked appropriately?

### 4. **Performance**
- Are there obvious inefficiencies (N+1 queries, unnecessary loops)?
- Is memory usage reasonable?
- Are there potential bottlenecks?
- Is caching used where appropriate?

### 5. **Maintainability**
- Is the code readable and well-structured?
- Are functions/methods appropriately sized?
- Is there unnecessary complexity?
- Are names descriptive and consistent?

### 6. **Test Coverage**
- Are critical paths tested?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Are tests meaningful (not just for coverage)?
- Are test failures informative?

---

## Verdict Types

The evaluator will provide one of three verdicts (applies to all evaluation modes):

### ✅ APPROVED
- **Meaning**: Content is sound, proceed to next step
- **Action**:
  - **Evaluation:** Assign task to specialized agent
  - **Proofreading:** Publish or commit document
- **Note**: May include minor suggestions or "watch for X"

### ⚠️ NEEDS_REVISION
- **Meaning**: Significant issues that need fixing
- **Action**: Address feedback and re-run command
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Evaluation:** Missing error handling, unclear dependencies, incomplete requirements
  - **Proofreading:** Confusing explanations, missing citations, style inconsistencies

### ❌ REJECT
- **Meaning**: Fundamental problems, major rework needed
- **Action**:
  - **Evaluation:** Redesign approach from scratch
  - **Proofreading:** Rewrite content with different structure/examples
- **Rare**: Usually only for fundamentally broken content

---

## Cost Expectations

**Note:** Costs vary by evaluator. Built-in evaluators use OpenAI; custom evaluators may use different providers with different pricing.

### Evaluation (`adversarial evaluate`)

**Per Evaluation (built-in):**
- $0.04-0.05 typical

**Typical Workflow:**
- $0.10-0.15 (2-3 evaluation rounds)

**File Size Limit:**
- ~988 lines may hit rate limits on Tier 1 OpenAI accounts (30k TPM limit)
- Files >500 lines require interactive confirmation

---

### Proofreading (`adversarial proofread`)

**Per Proofreading (built-in):**
- $0.01-0.02 typical (smaller documents)

**Typical Workflow:**
- $0.02-0.04 (1-2 proofreading rounds, teaching content stabilizes faster)

**File Size Limit:**
- Same as evaluation: ~988 lines may hit rate limits
- Files >500 lines require interactive confirmation
- Most teaching documents are <300 lines, well within limits

---

### Code Review (`adversarial review`)

**Per Review (built-in):**
- $0.02-0.05 typical (depends on code size)

**Typical Workflow:**
- $0.04-0.10 (1-2 review rounds, code often has concrete fixes)

**File Size Limit:**
- Same as evaluation: ~988 lines may hit rate limits
- Review directories to batch related files
- Can provide task context for better review accuracy

---

## Iteration Guidance

### For Plan Evaluation: 2-3 Rounds Optimal

**When to Stop Iterating:**

1. ✅ All CRITICAL/HIGH concerns addressed
2. ✅ Evaluator asking for implementation-level details (beyond planning scope)
3. ✅ Diminishing returns on planning detail
4. ✅ Manual planner review approves plan (planner override)

**Planner Override:**
The planner can approve NEEDS_REVISION plans when:
- Remaining issues are implementation-level details
- Evaluator is requesting specifics that will be resolved during coding
- 2-3 rounds completed and plan is "good enough"
- User needs to start implementation for time-sensitive work

---

### For Proofreading: 1-2 Rounds Optimal

**When to Stop Iterating:**

1. ✅ All CRITICAL/HIGH concerns addressed
2. ✅ Content is clear and accurate
3. ✅ Diminishing returns on wording tweaks
4. ✅ Manual agent/planner review approves content

**Agent Override:**
Agents can approve NEEDS_REVISION content when:
- Remaining issues are minor style preferences
- Evaluator is suggesting cosmetic changes
- 1-2 rounds completed and content teaches effectively
- Time-sensitive publication needed

**Note:** Teaching content typically stabilizes faster than code plans (fewer iterations needed).

---

## Known Issues

### 1. Wrapper Verdict Bug
**Issue**: CLI wrapper may report "✅ Evaluation approved!" even when the actual verdict is NEEDS_REVISION
**Solution**: **Always check the log file** for the actual verdict
**File**: `.adversarial/logs/TASK-*-PLAN-EVALUATION.md`

### 2. Large Files & Rate Limiting
**Issue**: Files >500 lines may fail or trigger authentication issues on Tier 1 OpenAI accounts (30k TPM limit)
**Symptoms**:
- OpenRouter authentication window opens unexpectedly
- "Invalid authorization header" errors
- Aider falls back to alternative providers
**Root Cause**: When OpenAI rate limits are hit, Aider attempts to use OpenRouter as fallback
**Solution**:
- Break large tasks into smaller subtasks (recommended)
- Upgrade OpenAI account tier for higher rate limits
- Wait a few minutes and retry if transient rate limit hit
**Note**: If OpenRouter auth window appears, the issue is likely a large file triggering OpenAI rate limits, not an invalid API key

### 3. Interactive Mode
**Issue**: Command requires interactive confirmation for large files (>500 lines)
**Solution**: Use `echo y | adversarial evaluate <task-file>` to automatically confirm the evaluation

### 4. Git Warning
**Issue**: May show "Unable to list files in git repo: BadObject" warning
**Solution**: Ignore - non-critical, Aider still functions correctly
**Context**: Related to git history cleanup, doesn't affect evaluations

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

**For Plan Evaluation:**
- Use `evaluate` for **high-level plan validation** (not implementation details)
- Address **CRITICAL and HIGH priority feedback** first
- Focus on **the evaluator's questions**, not just the verdict
- Manual **planner approval supersedes** evaluator verdict when appropriate

**For Proofreading:**
- Use `proofread` for **teaching content** (not code plans)
- Address **clarity and accuracy issues** first
- Focus on **pedagogical effectiveness**
- Manual **agent approval supersedes** evaluator verdict when appropriate

**For Both:**
- Always check `.adversarial/logs/` file for actual verdict (wrapper may lie)
- Choose the right mode: `evaluate` for code, `proofread` for teaching

### ⚠️ USE JUDGMENT:

- MEDIUM/LOW feedback may be minor preferences (not worth extensive revision)
- Don't iterate indefinitely - use judgment after optimal rounds
- Balance thoroughness with velocity
- Consider cost vs value for large documents

### ❌ DON'T:

- Don't use Task tool to invoke these commands (evaluators are external via CLI, not Claude agents)
- Don't confuse "new tabs" instruction (for manual user review) with adversarial workflow (external evaluator)
- Don't use `evaluate` on teaching content (use `proofread`)
- Don't use `proofread` on code plans (use `evaluate`)
- Don't skip for complex/risky content
- Don't ignore CRITICAL concerns from the evaluator

---
