## Related Tasks

**Parent Task**: TASK-NNNN (Task Title) [if this task was decomposed from a larger task]
**Depends On**: TASK-NNNN, TASK-MMMM [tasks that must complete before this one]
**Blocks**: TASK-PPPP, TASK-QQQQ [tasks that cannot start until this completes]
**Related**: TASK-RRRR, TASK-SSSS [tasks in the same initiative/theme]

<!-- Related Tasks Section:
Use this section to show relationships between tasks. This replaces the old approach
of creating subtasks with suffixes like TASK-NNNN-A, TASK-NNNN-B.

Guidelines:
- If a task becomes too large, decompose it into multiple INDEPENDENT tasks
- Each task gets its own TASK-NNNN ID (not TASK-NNNN-A suffixes)
- Use "Parent Task" to link back to the original task
- Use "Depends On" for sequential dependencies
- Use "Blocks" to show what's waiting on this task
- Use "Related" for tasks in the same initiative but no hard dependencies

Example (Task Decomposition):
  Original: TASK-0100 (too large)
  Decomposed into:
    - TASK-0200 (Part 1) → Parent Task: TASK-0100
    - TASK-0201 (Part 2) → Parent Task: TASK-0100, Depends On: TASK-0200
    - TASK-0202 (Part 3) → Parent Task: TASK-0100, Depends On: TASK-0201

Each task is independent, trackable in Linear, and shows clear relationships.

<!-- Status History Section:
This section is automatically maintained by task-monitor.py when you move task files
between folders. Each entry shows:

## Overview

[1-2 paragraph description of the task. What needs to be done and why it matters.]

**Context**: [Background information, related work, or upstream dependencies]

**Related Work**: [Links to related tasks, ADRs, or previous investigations]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. [Requirement 1 - specific, measurable]
2. [Requirement 2 - specific, measurable]
3. [Requirement 3 - specific, measurable]

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: [Specific targets]
- [ ] Reliability: [Specific targets]
- [ ] Security: [Specific considerations]
- [ ] Maintainability: [Code quality standards]

## TDD Workflow (Mandatory)

**Test-Driven Development Approach**:

1. **Before coding**: Copy `tests/test_template.py` → `tests/test_<feature>.py`
2. **Red**: Write failing tests for feature (describe expected behavior)
3. **Green**: Implement minimum code until tests pass
4. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
5. **Commit**: Pre-commit hook runs tests automatically

**TDD Benefits for this task**:
- [Benefit 1 - e.g., "Ensures API contract stability"]
- [Benefit 2 - e.g., "Catches edge cases early"]
- [Benefit 3 - e.g., "Documents expected behavior"]

### Test Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all new functions/classes
- [ ] Integration tests for workflows
- [ ] Error handling tests for edge cases
- [ ] Performance tests for critical paths (mark @pytest.mark.slow)
- [ ] Edge case tests: [List specific edge cases]

**Test files to create**:
- `tests/test_<feature>.py` - Main test suite
- `tests/integration/test_<feature>_integration.py` - Integration tests (if needed)

## Test Coverage Requirements

**Coverage Targets**:
- [ ] New code: **80%+ line coverage** (mandatory)
- [ ] Overall coverage: **≥53%** (maintain baseline)
- [ ] Critical paths: **100% coverage** (mandatory)
- [ ] Error paths: **80%+ coverage**

**Coverage Verification**:
```bash
# Check coverage for new files
pytest tests/test_<feature>.py --cov=your_project/<module> --cov-report=term-missing

# Verify no coverage regression
pytest tests/ --cov=thematic_cuts --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=53
```

**Critical Paths** (require 100% coverage):
1. [Critical path 1 - e.g., "Data validation logic"]
2. [Critical path 2 - e.g., "Error handling for user input"]
3. [Critical path 3 - e.g., "File save operations"]

## Pre-Commit/Pre-Push Requirements (Mandatory)

### Before Every Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
# → Pre-commit hook runs automatically:
#    1. Black (formatting)
#    2. isort (imports)
#    3. flake8 (linting)
#    4. pytest (fast tests)
```

**If tests fail**: Commit is blocked. Fix issues and retry.

**WIP commits only** (use sparingly):
```bash
SKIP_TESTS=1 git commit -m "WIP: work in progress"
```

### Before Every Push (MANDATORY)
```bash
# MANDATORY: Run full CI check locally
./scripts/ci-check.sh

# Only push if ci-check passes
git push origin main
```

**What ci-check.sh does**:
- ✅ Full test suite (including slow tests)
- ✅ Coverage threshold check (53%+)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks verification
- ✅ Uncommitted changes check

**Benefits**: Prevents 80%+ of CI failures, faster feedback than waiting for GitHub Actions.

**Recommended alias** (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):
```bash
alias gpush="./scripts/ci-check.sh && git push origin main"
```

3. Implement feature: [What to implement]
4. Run tests (should pass): `pytest tests/test_<feature>.py -v`
5. Refactor if needed

        # Implementation approach
        pass

## FOR API TASKS: Add This Section

## API Testing Requirements (ADR-0035)

**Consumer-First Testing Approach**:

API tests must validate from the **consumer perspective**, not just implementation correctness.

### Required Test Categories

1. **Contract Tests** (`tests/api/contracts/`)
   - [ ] Validate responses against OpenAPI spec
   - [ ] Test all endpoints with valid requests
   - [ ] Test all error responses match spec
   - [ ] Verify response schema compliance

2. **Consumer Tests** (`tests/api/consumers/`)
   - [ ] Test from Swift app perspective
   - [ ] Test from Electron app perspective
   - [ ] Test from CLI perspective
   - [ ] Verify responses work with consumer parsers

3. **Quality Tests** (`tests/api/quality/`)
   - [ ] No null pollution (no unnecessary null fields)
   - [ ] Minimal responses (no bloated data)
   - [ ] Consistent field presence rules
   - [ ] Response size efficiency

4. **Version Tests** (`tests/api/versions/`)
   - [ ] Test all supported API versions
   - [ ] Verify backward compatibility
   - [ ] Test version migration paths

### API Test Coverage Targets
- [ ] All endpoints: 100% coverage
- [ ] All error codes: 100% coverage
- [ ] All API versions: 100% coverage
- [ ] Consumer scenarios: 80%+ coverage

### API Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all API tests
pytest tests/api/ -v

# Run contract validation
pytest tests/api/contracts/ -v

# Run quality checks
pytest tests/api/quality/ -v

# Verify against OpenAPI spec
pytest tests/api/test_openapi_compliance.py -v
```

- **OpenAPI Spec**: `openapi/api-YYYY-MM-DD.yaml` (if applicable)
