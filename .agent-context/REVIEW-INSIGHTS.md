## How to Use This File

**For Agents Starting Work**:
1. Check relevant module sections before implementation
2. Review "Patterns & Anti-Patterns" for established conventions
3. Note any integration requirements that affect your work

**For Planner Completing Tasks**:
1. After moving task to `5-done/`, read the review file
2. Extract high-signal insights (not everything, just what's reusable)
3. Append entries under appropriate sections
4. Always include task ID for traceability

## Index by Module

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

- **ASK-0025**: Inline Python via `-c` in bash scripts follows `teams` command pattern - acceptable for smaller scripts
- **ASK-0025**: For large inline scripts (185+ lines), consider extracting to separate module (e.g., `scripts/check_sync_status.py`) for testability
- **ASK-0027**: Support multiple YAML field names (e.g., both `name:` and `project_name:`) with first-match-wins logic
- **ASK-0027**: Watch for path resolution bugs in `project_dir` handling - use `Path.resolve()` consistently

### CLI (`scripts/project`)

- **ASK-0025**: User-friendly output should include actionable next steps (e.g., "Run ./scripts/project linearsync to sync")
- **ASK-0025**: Limit verbose output lists (e.g., show max 5 missing tasks, then "and N more...")
- **ASK-0027**: Progress reporting pattern - show status for each file/item processed
- **ASK-0027**: Idempotent commands - safe to run multiple times without unintended side effects
- **ASK-0028**: Subprocess calls should use `capture_output=True, text=True` for proper error capture
- **ASK-0028**: Truncate long error output (e.g., `stderr[-500:]`) with manual remediation instructions
- **ASK-0028**: Detect corrupted state (e.g., missing venv python) and suggest `--force` flag
- **ASK-0029**: Library installers should track version + commit hash in `.installed-version` for auditability
- **ASK-0029**: Pin external content installers to specific versions (tags), not just "latest"
- **ASK-0029**: Support `--force` for reinstallation and `--ref <tag>` for version override
- **ASK-0032**: Use `shutil.which()` for tool detection - simple and reliable
- **ASK-0032**: Provide primary recommendation with alternatives in error messages (uv → pyenv → manual)
- **ASK-0032**: Use generous timeouts (600s) for operations that may download large files

### Tests (`tests/`)

- **ASK-0025**: CLI entry points excluded from coverage (pyproject.toml), but core logic should be extractable into testable functions
- **ASK-0025**: Consider extracting comparison/validation logic from CLI commands into utility modules for unit testing
- **ASK-0032**: Use `conftest.py` for shared fixtures - improves test maintainability
- **ASK-0032**: MockVersionInfo class pattern: handle both tuple comparison (`>=`) and attribute access (`.major`)

## Patterns & Anti-Patterns

### Recommended Patterns

- **Idempotent CLI**: Design commands to be safe for repeated execution (ASK-0027)
- **Actionable Output**: Include specific next-step commands in error/status messages (ASK-0025)
- **Output Limiting**: Cap verbose lists with "and N more..." to avoid overwhelming users (ASK-0025)
- **Dual Config Support**: Accept multiple field names for config values, take first match (ASK-0027)
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files without swallowing errors (ASK-0027)
- **Type Hints + Docstrings**: Include for maintainability in all new code (ASK-0027)
- **Progress Reporting**: Show per-item status for batch operations (ASK-0027)
- **Optional Dependencies**: Use `GQL_AVAILABLE` flag pattern instead of `sys.exit(1)` at import time (ASK-0028, KIT-ADR-0005)
- **Subprocess Error Capture**: Always use `capture_output=True, text=True` and check return codes (ASK-0028)
- **Provider-Agnostic Design**: Avoid hard-coded model/provider names in documentation; use generic terms with "see docs for options" (ASK-0029)
- **Version Pinning for External Content**: Pin to tags by default, record commit hash for auditability (ASK-0029)
- **Non-Intrusive Feature Flags**: New features should only activate for relevant scenarios (e.g., Python 3.13+ only) (ASK-0032)
- **Tiered Error Messages**: Primary recommendation → alternatives → manual fallback (ASK-0032)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Massive Inline Scripts**: Inline Python >100 lines in bash scripts hurts maintainability and testability (ASK-0025)
- **Untestable CLI Logic**: Embedding all logic in CLI entry points prevents unit testing - extract core logic (ASK-0025)
- **Silent Failures**: Operations that can fail silently (like Linear sync) need verification commands (ASK-0025)

---

## Integration Notes

- **Linear Sync**: Use `./scripts/project sync-status` after commits to verify Linear is updated (ASK-0025)
- **Upstream Merges**: Run `./scripts/project reconfigure` after pulling upstream changes to update agent files (ASK-0027)
- **New Project Setup**: Run `./scripts/project setup` to create venv and install dependencies (ASK-0028)
- **Evaluator Installation**: Run `./scripts/project install-evaluators` to add additional evaluation providers (ASK-0029)
