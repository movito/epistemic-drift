# Operational Rules for All Agents

**Version**: 2.1
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-28
**Applies To**: ALL agents in this project

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Task Tool Permission Requirements

### The Problem (RESOLVED)

**Task tool subagents require explicit tool permissions** in `.claude/settings.local.json` to perform filesystem operations.

### Root Cause (Previously Misunderstood)

**Previous misdiagnosis**: We believed Task tool agents ran in ephemeral sandboxes that couldn't persist changes.

**Actual cause**: Our `.claude/settings.local.json` was missing `Write` and `Edit` permissions. Subagents invoked via Task tool inherit project permissions, which only included `Read` and `Bash` tools.

### Resolution (2025-11-12)

Added the following permissions to `.claude/settings.local.json`:
- `Write`
- `Edit`
- `Glob`
- `Grep`
- `TodoWrite`

Subagents can now perform filesystem operations when launched via Task tool.

## ✅ Task Tool Usage Guidelines

### Task Tool CAN Now Be Used For:

With proper permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`, subagents launched via Task tool can:

- **Research and codebase exploration** (Explore agent)
- **Analysis and investigation tasks**
- **Answering questions about code**
- **Searching for patterns or files**
- **Reading documentation**
- **Gathering information**
- **Creating files** (with Write permission)
- **Editing files** (with Edit permission)
- **Git commits** (with Bash permission)
- **Installing dependencies** (with Bash permission)
- **Running tests** (with Bash permission)
- **Building projects** (with Bash permission)

### Best Practices

**When to use Task tool for implementation:**
- ✅ Complex multi-step tasks that benefit from specialized agent context
- ✅ Tasks where delegation improves clarity and separation of concerns
- ✅ When you want implementation work tracked in a separate agent context

**When to use direct tools:**
- ✅ Simple, single-file edits in main conversation
- ✅ Quick fixes that don't need specialized agent overhead
- ✅ When you're already in the appropriate agent context

### User Instruction Clarification

The `.claude/CLAUDE.md` instruction **"Always launch agents in new tabs"** can mean:
- ✅ **UI tabs in Claude Desktop** (multiple conversations) - preferred for user visibility
- ✅ **Task tool invocations** (now functional with proper permissions) - acceptable for complex delegated work

---

## Verification

After completing work that should modify files (whether via Task tool or direct):
1. ✅ Check `git status` shows actual changes
2. ✅ Verify files exist at expected paths
3. ✅ Confirm commits appear in `git log`

If any verification fails, check:
- Are the required tools in `.claude/settings.local.json` permissions?
- Did the operation complete without errors?

## Permission Configuration Reference

**Required tools in `.claude/settings.local.json` for full subagent functionality:**

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Write",
      "Edit",
      "Glob",
      "Grep",
      "Read",
      "TodoWrite",
      "Bash(...)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Questions?

If subagents report creating files but nothing appears on disk, check `.claude/settings.local.json` permissions first.

---

## 📁 File Location Standards

### ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

**Correct location**: `docs/decisions/adr/ADR-NNNN-short-title.md`

**DO NOT create ADRs in**:
- ❌ `.claude/` (agent/settings directory, not for project documentation)
- ❌ Root directory
- ❌ `.agent-context/` (coordination files only)

**Before creating an ADR**: Read `.agent-context/workflows/ADR-CREATION-WORKFLOW.md` for template and numbering.

### Tasks

**Correct location**: `delegation/tasks/[status-folder]/TASK-NNNN-title.md`

Status folders:
- `1-backlog/` - Planned but not started
- `2-todo/` - Ready for work
- `3-in-progress/` - Currently being worked on
- `5-done/` - Completed

### Research Documents

**Correct location**: Project-specific research folder (e.g., `docs/research/`, `research/`, or project-defined location)

### Agent Definitions

**Correct location**: `.claude/agents/[agent-name].md`

This is the ONLY documentation type that belongs in `.claude/`.

---

## Why File Locations Matter

1. **Discoverability**: Standard locations make it easy to find documents
2. **Tool Integration**: Linear sync, ADR numbering, and other tools expect specific paths
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Agent definitions (`.claude/`) vs. project documentation (`docs/`)
4. **Template Inheritance**: New agents copy the template; correct locations propagate automatically

---

## 🐍 Virtual Environment Handling

### Before Running pip Commands

1. **Check if venv exists**: `ls .venv/bin/activate 2>/dev/null`
2. **If not, suggest setup**: `./scripts/project setup`
3. **Always use venv pip**: `.venv/bin/pip install ...`

### Why This Matters

macOS Homebrew Python is "externally managed" and blocks system-wide pip installs:
```
error: externally-managed-environment
× This environment is externally managed
```

**Never run `pip install` with system Python on macOS.**

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Set up venv (first time or if missing)
./scripts/project setup

# Activate venv (each terminal session)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (when venv is active)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Force recreate venv (if corrupted)
./scripts/project setup --force
```

### Detecting Corrupted venv

If you see:
```
⚠️  Corrupted venv detected (missing python)
```

Run: `./scripts/project setup --force`
