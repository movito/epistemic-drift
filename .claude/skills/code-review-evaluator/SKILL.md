# Code-Review Evaluator

Run after bot triage rounds are complete, before human review. Uses a different model family (o1/Gemini) to find edge-case bugs that bots and Claude miss.

## When to Run

- After all bot threads are resolved (0 unresolved)
- Before requesting human code review

## When to Skip

### Auto-skip (<10 lines source)

Skip without deliberation when ALL are true:

- **< 10 lines of source changed** (not counting tests, docs, or config)
- **No new functions or classes**
- **No external integrations**

Running the evaluator on a trivial change (e.g., a 3-line contextlib.suppress fix) has zero ROI.

### Discretionary skip (10-20 lines source)

You may skip the evaluator when ALL of these conditions are true:

- **< 20 lines of logic changed** (not counting tests, docs, or config)
- **No new functions or classes** (only modifications to existing ones)
- **No external integrations** (no subprocess, API calls, or new dependencies)
- **Established patterns only** (all code follows existing patterns in the codebase)

### Always document the skip

```bash
echo "# Evaluator skipped: <N lines logic, no new functions, no external integrations" \
  > .agent-context/reviews/<TASK-ID>-evaluator-review.md
```

**When in doubt, run it.** The fast variant costs ~$0.004 and takes 30 seconds.

## Step 1: Prepare Input

Create `.adversarial/inputs/<TASK-ID>-code-review-input.md` using the template at `.adversarial/templates/code-review-input-template.md`.

Use the PR's original task ID. If the input file already exists from a previous run, append `-r2`:

- First run: `<TASK-ID>-code-review-input.md`
- Follow-up: `<TASK-ID>-code-review-input-r2.md`

**CRITICAL: Include FULL file content, not diffs or excerpts.** The evaluator cannot
reason about imports, error handling context, or module-level state from partial code.
Diff-only inputs produce false positives (high false positive rate observed empirically).

Include:
- Full source of all new/changed files (complete files, not diffs)
- Full test file
- Summary of what bots found and how it was addressed

## Step 2: Run the Evaluator

### Available evaluators

| Command | Model | Cost | API Key Env Var |
|---------|-------|------|-----------------|
| `adversarial code-reviewer` | o1 (OpenAI) | ~$0.33/run | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `adversarial code-reviewer-fast` | Gemini Flash | ~$0.004/run | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |

**Note**: `spec-compliance-fast` is NOT available — use manual spec checks or `/check-spec` (Gemini Flash via API) instead.

If the required API key is missing, fall back to the other evaluator. If neither key is set, document the failure and proceed to human review.

```bash
# Deep analysis (recommended for substantial PRs)
adversarial code-reviewer .adversarial/inputs/<TASK-ID>-code-review-input.md

# Fast variant (for small changes or iteration)
adversarial code-reviewer-fast .adversarial/inputs/<TASK-ID>-code-review-input.md
```

## Step 3: Read and Address Findings

Output lands in `.adversarial/logs/`:

```bash
# First run:
cat .adversarial/logs/<TASK-ID>-code-review-input--code-reviewer.md.md

# Follow-up:
cat .adversarial/logs/<TASK-ID>-code-review-input-r2--code-reviewer.md.md
```

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **FAIL** | Fix the identified bugs, push, and re-run the evaluator |
| **CONCERNS** | Address test gaps and robustness issues, push |
| **PASS** | Proceed to human review |

## Step 4: Persist Output

Copy to `.agent-context/reviews/` so it's tracked in git:

```bash
# First run:
cp .adversarial/logs/<TASK-ID>-code-review-input--code-reviewer.md.md \
   .agent-context/reviews/<TASK-ID>-evaluator-review.md

# Follow-up:
cp .adversarial/logs/<TASK-ID>-code-review-input-r2--code-reviewer.md.md \
   .agent-context/reviews/<TASK-ID>-evaluator-review-r2.md
```

Include this file in your next commit.
